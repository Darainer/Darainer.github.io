I've developed software for cars, planes, drones and submarines with a mix of C, C++, matlab and python especially for systems design and analysis.

My most significant domain knowledge is in the area of automated driving technology, where i have worked for the last 10 years mostly on the development of automated assistence functions (Adaptive Cruise Control, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Traffic Jam Assist). Working in early concept development environments, i benefited from broad exposure to many algorithms in perception, tracking and control and also spent many days on the test track bringing my software to life in test vehicles. Before specializing in automated driving i worked on a variety of other automotive software applications including hybrid all wheel drive and Electronic stability control (ESC).

i would not consider myself a true connoisseur or a master of any of the major programming languages, but have developed an exceptionally strong problem solving ability that comes from 20 years of engineering. With complex software rich product development environments like in Automated driving i strongly believe the secret sauce for high performing teams is bringing together a complementary group of experts to own all the facets of their problem. 

I have had the opportunity to build teams of engineers around a mission, and enjoy the leadership and mentoring aspects of developing software products.

As much as i still occasionally enjoy the opportunity to program something, my focus is currently more at the intersection between software systems design, product managment and business.
